Version v1.21.1
---------------

This is a very minor release that catches some warnings (logged to the console at error previously)
when loading ads manually. This means that using `data-verbosity="quiet"` will now catch them.

:date: October 17, 2024

 * @davidfischer: Catch warnings when loading manually (#221)


Version v1.21.0
---------------

This release again makes some tweaks to our ad rotation algorithm
by making it more configurable and disabling at least temporarily
visibilitychange ad rotations.

:date: October 17, 2024

 * @davidfischer: Make visibilitychange rotation an option (#214)


Version v1.20.0
---------------

This release again makes some tweaks to our ad rotation algorithm
specifically around the timeframe and delay.

Version v1.19.0

Release v1.18.0 was tested but never widely adopted as we saw a performance (CTR) degradation.

problems that we saw in the previous release.

:date: September 24, 2024

 * @davidfischer: Add a delay before a visibilitychange rotation (#209)

 * @davidfischer: The stickybox shouldn't float except on ultrawide (#137)


Version v1.6.1
--------------

This release fixed a viewport detection issue that pertained
to styled ads (fixedfooter and stickybox) that cause issues
with views being counted for them.
This release also contained a minor docs fix.

:date: August 29, 2022

 * @davidfischer: Position the outer div for styled ads (#134)

Starting in this release, they are.

:date: June 20, 2022

 * @davidfischer: Make publisher-house ads enabled by default (#119)


Version v1.4.4
--------------

During the rollout of v1.4.3, we noticed that warnings were treated as errors
in some situations due to a poorly documented, browser specific ``window.debug``.
We are just not going to rely on that.

:date: June 9, 2022

 * @davidfischer: Always treat warnings as warnings (#117)


Version v1.4.3
--------------

Fixes a release issue with 1.4.2.

:date: June 9, 2022


Version v1.4.2

 * @davidfischer: Silence the no ads to show warning (#111)
 * @ericholscher: Highlight fallback ads (#109)
 * @dependabot[bot]: Bump url-parse from 1.5.3 to 1.5.7 (#104)
 * @dependabot[bot]: Bump follow-redirects from 1.12.1 to 1.14.7 (#96)
 * @davidfischer: "Placement is configured with invalid parameters" when there's just no ad to show (#26)


Version v1.4.1
---------------

This was a very minor change to a ``z-index`` that could
obscure some content when using the stickybox placement.

:date: January 25, 2022

 * @davidfischer: Decrease the z-index below most modals (#98)
 * @davidfischer: Tweak around releasing versions (#97)


Version v1.4.0
---------------

The big change here is to add custom placements with the ``data-ea-style``
option.

:date: December 3, 2021

 * @davidfischer: Add stickybox floating placement to ad client (#94)
 * @davidfischer: Add MIT License file (#93)
 * @sureshjoshi: Static site support using CSS in lieu of JS (#92)
 * @voxpelli: Add `LICENSE` file to make license more discoverable by eg. GitHub (#89)


Version v1.3.0
---------------

In this change we removed our polyfills to support IE11.
This shrinks the client by about 40%.
We also move to support multiple placements on a page.
This isn't something we're recommending to publishers (and in fact, you won't make more doing this)
but a publisher who is beta testing our sponsorship model is using this feature.

**Note:** Drops support for IE11.

:date: September 2, 2021

 * @davidfischer: Remove polyfills and drop IE11 support (#88)
 * @davidfischer: Support multiple placements on a page (#87)
 * @davidfischer: Use ponyfills instead of polyfills to not change state on others' sites (#62)

sent from the server.

:date: August 13, 2021

 * @davidfischer: Use a separate view time endpoint (#85)
 * @dependabot[bot]: Bump url-parse from 1.5.1 to 1.5.3 (#84)
 * @davidfischer: Document the versioning process of the client (#83)
 * @dependabot[bot]: Bump path-parse from 1.0.6 to 1.0.7 (#82)


Version v1.1.1
---------------

There was a minor fix to new code that sends the amount of time an ad was viewed.

:date: August 5, 2021

 * @davidfischer: Remove the view time listener after sending (#80)


Version v1.1.0
---------------

The major changes in this release were to send the client version with the ad request.
In the future, we will begin warning users if their ad client is very out of date.
The other major change was to send the amount of time an ad was viewed
when the browser/page/tab loses focus or is closed.
This is an important advertiser metric and we believe that we may be able to charge
advertisers additional rates for high view time placements.

:date: August 5, 2021

 * @davidfischer: Allowing forcing a specific ad campaign (#77)
 * @davidfischer: Send the ad view time to the server (#76)
